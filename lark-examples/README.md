# Lark Examples

A bunch of examples written in the lark grammar format. Ideas pulled from various other papers which I have listed here as much as possible. 


## From mimid (Andreas Zeller work)

- calc: basic calculator
- mathexpr: inspired from [this repo](https://github.com/louisfisch/mathematical-expressions-parser/blob/master/eval.py)
