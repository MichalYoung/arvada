# Arvada

A tool to infer grammars from an example set and a correctness oracle, that can be used for both generation and parsing tasks.

## Building

Requires python3 to run. Install the following two packages via pip to make sure everything runs:
```
$ pip3 install lark-parser
$ pip3 install tqdm
```

## Running Arvada

Suppose you have a directory containing a set of examples, `TRAIN_DIR`, and an oracle for a valid example, `ORACLE_CMD`. The restrictions on `ORACLE_CMD` are as follows:

- `ORACLE_CMD filename` should run the oracle on the file with name `filename`
- `ORACLE_CMD filename` should return 0 if the example in `filename` is valid, and an exit code greater than 0 if it is invalid. 

You can then run Arvada via:
```
$ python3 search.py external ORACLE_CMD TRAIN_DIR LOG_FILE
```
this will store the learned grammar as a pickled dictionary in `LOG_FILE.gramdict`, and some information about training in `LOG_FILE`.

If you also have a held-out test set in `TEST_DIR`, you can evaluate the precision and recall of the mined grammar with the utility `eval.py`. This utility also handily prints out the unpickled grammar. The provided `LOG_FILE` must match one generated by search.py, as this utility looks for `LOG_FILE.gramdict`. 
```
$ python3 eval.py external ORACLE_CMD TEST_DIR LOG_FILE
```

Of course, if you do not have a held-out test set, you can still evaluate the precision of the mined grammar by using your training directory as test:
```
$ python3 eval.py external ORACLE_CMD TRAIN_DIR LOG_FILE
```
The Recall should be 1.0 in this case.


## Minimal working example

The directory `bc-example` contains a minimal example of learning a calculator language from a set of example and the correctness oracle as the `bc` program running without syntax errors.

First ensure that [`bc`](https://www.gnu.org/software/bc/manual/html_mono/bc.html) is installed; it should come standard on most linux distributions. If everything works fine, the following command should run without error:
```
$ ./bc-example/bc-wrapper.sh bc-example/train_set/guide-0.ex
```

You can learn a grammar from the oracle `./bc-example/bc-wrapper` and the provided examples in `bc-example/train_set` as follows:
```
$ python3 search.py external .bc-example/bc-wrapper.sh bc-example/train_set bc-example.log
```
(this took around 45 seconds on our machine)

The grammar is stored as a pickled object in `bc-example.log.gramdict`. The `eval.py` utility will print out the grammar in `bc-example.log.eval` after running: 
```
$ python3 search.py external .bc-example/bc-wrapper.sh bc-example/test_set bc-example.log
```
over 5 runs, we witnessed recall of 0.03, 0.06, 0.07, 0.16, 0.61, and precision consistently around 0.9. 

*Note:* the behavior of this minimal example differs from the arith example in the paper because (1) the set of training examples has been made smaller for illustration purposes and (2) the language accepted by the oracle (`bc`) is a large superset of that in the training and testing set.
